        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Nagoriyuki is a mid-ranged powerhouse who dynamically shifts between extended pressure strings 
            which threaten strike/throw mix-ups and space control with massive normals, depending on what 
            the Blood Rage mechanic allows.

            Nagoriyuki's long and rewarding f.S and 2S control mid-ranged neutral. His 5K is a good poke 
            for stagger pressure due to its excellent range and frame data. His exceptional special moves 
            have the unique boon of being special-to-special cancelable. This includes Fukyo, a command dash 
            that compensates for his weak mobility. Fukyo also grants devastating pressure in the form of strike/throw 
            mix-ups when combined with normals and other specials. Kamuriyuki is especially powerful for frame 
            traps and doubles as a gap-closing tool. Furthermore, using specials has the side effect of filling his 
            unique resource, the Blood Gauge. Filling it boosts the speed, range and power of his H normals, 
            transforming 5H and 2H into outstanding space control tools against grounded and aerial opponents, respectively.
            
            The Blood Gauge must be filled cautiously, however, as filling it completely forces Nagoriyuki into Blood 
            Rage, a state so punishing that triggering it in ill opportune moments renders defeat near certain. Deplete 
            the Blood Gauge by connecting H normals or by feasting with Bloodsucking Universe, a command grab. This is 
            vital for controlling the Blood Gauge and averting an untimely demise to Blood Rage. Excelling with Nagoriyuki 
            requires constant situational awareness and Blood Gauge management by adeptly shifting tactics midmatch. 
            Players skilled enough to manage the gauge to one or two bars are rewarded with enhanced H normals while still 
            having the leeway to utilize stellar special moves.
            
            Memorize the Blood Gauge's behavior by heart and sharpen your instincts to stop approaches with your blade. 
            Now it’s time to feast!</p>

                                   <ul>
                                       <li><strong>Massive Range:</strong> Nagoriyuki's giant katana lets him safely control the screen 
                                           from further ranges than most of the cast. His range must be respected because 
                                           of the sizable chunk of damage each hit deals.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Blood Gauge: </strong>Blood Gauge: Increasing the Blood Gauge boosts the speed, range and power of 
                                           his HS normals, transforming them into outstanding space control tools.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Astounding Durability:</strong> Equipped with a strong defense modifier, a high Guts 
                                           Rating and a command throw that restores health, Nagoriyuki is as durable 
                                           as a warrior can be.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Special Cancels:</strong> Has the unique ability to cancel specials into other specials, 
                                           allowing for unique pressure routes and combo routes.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Brutal Punishment:</strong> His long range, high damage and special cancels means that 
                                           any mistake the opponent makes can be massively punished, especially so on a 
                                           counter hit. He is classified as a One-Shot type for a reason.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Strong Pressure:</strong> Nagoriyuki's ability to cancel his moves with Fukyo gives 
                                           him instant strike/throw mix-ups with devastating frame traps, which is 
                                           further reinforced by his command grab and his unique ability to deal chip 
                                           damage with normals. He can also Fukyo backwards to bait responses and punish.</li>

                                       <li><strong>Blood Rage:</strong> If he mismanages Blood Gauge he will be forced into Blood Rage, a 
                                           mode that is difficult to exit and has three punishing drawbacks:</li>
                                           <ul>
                                               <li>He loses access to all of his special moves.</li>
                                               <li>50% of his maximum health is drained during its duration.</li>
                                               <li>The activation has a long, easily punishable animation.</li>
                                           </ul>
                                       <li><strong>Limited Mobility:</strong> Does not have a dash, air dash or double jump. 
                                           Fukyo forces him to spend blood meter in order to approach quickly. 
                                           Not having access to special moves in Blood Rage means he cannot command 
                                           dash, either.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Weak to Pressure:</strong> Nagoriyuki's limited mobility exacerbates specific 
                                           problems on defense. Common tactics for getting out of the corner in 
                                           Guilty Gear games include super jumping or air dashing over the opponent's reset. 
                                           Nagoriyuki can't air dash and his super jump has significant startup, so he 
                                           will be forced to look for places to punish, abare, reversal, or otherwise 
                                           force a turn.</li>
                                   </ul>

                           </tr>
                       </tbody>
                       <tbody>
                           <tr>

                                <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Nagoriyuki's Super jump is unique, and behaves more similarly to a launch jump from other 
                                games. It covers more horizontal and vertical distance than other jumps. It comes with the downside 
                                of significant startup. This can both help and hurt Nagoriyuki depending on the circumstance and matchup. 
                                Tied to this, is how mobility applies to defense. Nagoriyuki's limited mobility exacerbate specific 
                                problems on defense. Common tactics for getting out of the corner in Guilty Gear games include superjumping or 
                                air-dashing over the opponent's reset. Nagoriyuki can't air dash and his superjump has significant startup,

            The Blood Gauge shown here is slightly more than half full</a>
            
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="blood_rage_content">
        <p>The Blood Gauge is a unique mechanic exclusive to Nagoriyuki. The gauge will start to fill when he uses special 
            moves. He can cancel special moves into each other, which will stack their effects. Filling the gauge increases the speed, range and power 
            of his H normals. The gauge depletes if he lands S normals, H normals, Bloodsucking Universe (623P) or Wasureyuki (632146S). It also depletes 
            passively over time.
    
            Increasing the Blood Gauge by one or two bars in order to take advantage of enhanced H normals is a crucial aspect of Nagoriyuki's gameplan. 
            However, filling it completely (300 blood points total) is very dangerous because doing so forces Nagoriyuki into Blood Rage, a mode with 
            several immense drawbacks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Loss of specials:</strong> Blood Rage takes away access to Nagoriyuki's specials, which are crucial for his ability to approach and mix up 
                    enemies. Without access to them you are forced to walk, jump, or high jump in order to close the distance. Without specials he has 
                    very little to open up a patient player with.</li>
                <li><strong>HP depletion:</strong> Blood Rage rapidly drains 50% of Nagoriyuki's maximum health over its duration, meaning every moment spent in Blood 
                    Rage has a hefty health cost. The health depletion cannot KO Nagoriyuki, but the health depletion persists even if Nagoriyuki is 
                    being comboed. As a result, getting caught in a combo during Blood Rage can spell a swift end.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformation animation:</strong> Entering Blood Rage forces a lengthy, non-damaging attack, allowing any character to set up whatever 
                    punish they want on whiff. On block the animation is less unsafe at -7, but leaves him at a disadvantage.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>In addition, Nagoriyuki has no good way to exit Blood Rage. The player can either let Blood Rage end naturally at the cost of 50% of their maximum health, 
            or spend 50% Tension on Zansetsu to end it early. The latter option is a -66 mid, so using it in neutral means every character in the game can easily play 
            reactively and punish it. The only advantages of Max Blood Rage is that his S and H attacks receive further buffs to range and damage and that he gets access 
            to his Zansetsu overdrive. The drawbacks of the mode massively outweigh the advantages, however, so it should be avoided.
            Nagoriyuki players must constantly keep note of how filled the Blood Gauge is and manage it carefully to avoid entering Blood Rage. It is integral to 
            understand how to maximise the benefits while mitigating the drawbacks of Blood Gauge in order to play Nagoriyuki effectively. There are some specific 
            scenarios where skilled players can make use of intentionally activating Blood Rage. For more on that and Blood Gauge in general, check the strategy page.</p>
